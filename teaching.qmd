I have experience teaching a wide range of courses primarily aimed at law students, but also open to students from the social sciences. At the University of Hamburg, I have taught at the Faculty of Law, both in the general curriculum and in the specialized focus area *Law and Economics* (*Schwerpunktbereich*), as well as in the Master’s program *Law and Economics of the Arab Region* (MLEA). My courses focus on legal topics approached from an interdisciplinary and empirical perspective.
